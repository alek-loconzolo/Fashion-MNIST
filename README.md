# Fashion-MNIST
Developed and trained a neural network using PyTorch to classify images in the Fashion-MNIST dataset, consisting of 60,000 training and 10,000 testing grayscale images. Accurately classified 28x28 pixel images into 10 fashion categories, such as t-shirts, coats, and bags, achieving over 90% accuracy.
